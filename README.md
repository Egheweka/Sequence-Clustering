# Sequence Clustering and Prototypical Sequence Generation
This repository contains Python scripts and a Jupyter notebook for clustering sequences into groups and generating novel prototypical sequences for each cluster. The task involves identifying inliers (sequences generated by distinct processes) and outliers (sequences generated by an unrelated process), clustering the inliers, and visualizing the clustering results.

**Files Provided**

test.txt

This file contains a mixture of inlier and outlier sequences in no particular order. Each line consists of an integer identifier followed by the sequence itself.

sequence_clustering.ipynb

This Jupyter notebook organizes and executes the following tasks:

•	**Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Reads test.txt to load sequences and preprocesses them (e.g., converting to lowercase).

•	**Clustering:** Utilizes K-means clustering to group inlier sequences into an appropriate number of clusters. Outliers are identified but not clustered.

•	**Prototypical Sequence Generation:** Generates novel prototypical sequences for each identified cluster. These sequences are representative of their respective clusters but are not identical to any provided sequences.

•	**Visualization:** Uses PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction and visualization of the clustering results in a 2D space.

**Notebook Execution**

To execute the notebook:

1.	Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

2.	Open the sequence_clustering.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment.

4.	Run each cell sequentially to load data, preprocess sequences, perform clustering, generate prototypical sequences, and visualize the results.

**Outputs**

•	**Cluster Assignments:** Each sequence's identifier is printed along with its cluster ID or marked as an outlier.

•	**Prototypical Sequences:** One novel prototypical sequence is printed for each cluster, demonstrating the most representative sequence for that cluster.

•	**Visualization:** A scatter plot visualizes the clusters in the PCA-transformed feature space, showing how well-separated the clusters are and the distribution of data points within each cluster.
